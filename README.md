# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
1. Turning data into easily consumable visual insights, using Tableau
2. Creating impactful dashboards that help audiences make decisions
3. Communicating insights with the correct visualizations


## Process
1. Data Extraction, Cleaning and Transforming
  1) Extract consumer index data from consumer_index.csv file
  2) Extract office index data from office_realestate_index.csv file
  3) Extract House Price data in different district from real_estate_prices.csv file
  4) Extract weekly salary data from weekly_earnings.json file, and convert weekly salary into monthly salary
  5) Convert all Date information into Date Type using Tableau

2. Data Visualization
  1) Import all dataset into Tableau
  2) Create Visualizations by WorkSheets according to the tasks
  3) Ceate Dashboads to compare different visualizations, and explore insights
	

## Results (Option 1)

1. The trend of house prices across Canada in the last 40 years 
   The house price index increases in the last 40 years, but it drops between 1983 and 1984, 
   early 1990s, between 2008 to 2009, and between 2018 to 2019. 
   	

2. Compare the trend after 2005 with actual benchmark prices 
   The actual benchmark prices has a similar pattern with the house price index from
   2005 to 2020; as they both decrease between 2008 and 2009, between 2018 to 2019.

3. Compare this trend with the trend of office prices. Which one is getting more expensive, faster?
   Comparing the house price trend with the trend of office prices from 1981 to 2017, in these 37 years,
   the office price index increases from 57.1 to 165.6. In comparison, the house price index increases from
   36.1 to 103.1. Therefore, the office price index and the house price increases 190.02% and 185.6% respectively.
   This means that the office price is getting more expensive and increasing faster

4. Create a map of Canada with current house prices for each available district.
   Comparing the Sept. 2020 house benchmark price with the June 2023 house benchmark price distribution,
   British Columnbia and Ontario have the highest and fastest increasing rate for house prices in Canda.
   For the cities, Vancouver and Toronto have the highest and fastest increasing rate for house prices in Canada

5. Compare the trend of house prices with earnings.
   The salary earnings increases from 2001 to 2015. It doesn't have a dip drop between 2008 and 2009.

6. Did people spend more of their earnings in 2014 than they did in 2001?
   Comparing consumer index with monthly earnings from 2001 to 2014, monthly earnings increases 38% versus
   consumer index which increases 23.37%. Therefore, people spend less of their earning in 2014 than they did in 2001.

7. There were several economic crises in the world in the last 40 years, including these four: Black Monday (1987), 
   Recession (early 1990s), dot com bubble (2000 - 2002), Financial crisis (2007 - 2009). Show the effect of these crises on:
  - Earnings
  - House prices
  - Office prices
  - House constructions
  - Consumer index
   By creating filter for years, and selecting the crises years in the dashboad 
   1) Earnings increases from 2001 to 2015
   2) Consumer index increases through 1984 to 2020
   3) The house price index has increased in the last 40 years, but it drops between 1983 and 1984, 
      early 1990s, between 2008 and 2009, and between 2018 to 2019
   4) Office price index increases from 1981 to 2017, but it drops between 1983 and 1984, 
      between 1990 and 1991, and between 2008 to 2009
   5) House construction prices drop from 1987 to early 1990s, and between 2007 to 2009

8. Plot consumer_index together with housing_price_index and fit the regression line between them. 
   Consumer index has a strong positive relationship with house price index. We can predict consumer index 
   from the housing price index

## Challenges 
   The most challenges I faced in the project is data cleaning and transforming, and communicate insights with 
   the correct visualizations

## Future Goals
   If I had more time, I would like to continue to explore data in depth, and create
   more impactful visualizations, explore insights
